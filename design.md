Design Doc
===========

We will program in Python for our project. 

We create classes for:
- creating lists of lists (matrices), the basis for keeping track of the routes we have.
- creating routes. For now we try to find a route from a to b with as few lines as possible (in 2D only). We evade the other logical gates.
- drawing the matrices and routes in a graphic interface
- in main we let all the classes work together.
